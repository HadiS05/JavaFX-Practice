<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>I wanted to try my hand at some other Java technologies. It'd been a long time since I did a GUI project in Java, the latest one being a Swing GUI in high school Computer Science.
So, now I'm back, trying my hand at JavaFX. The inclination towards JavaFX mainly comes from the styling capabilities, the complexity, and the addition of CSS. 
The library has known to be a bit complex, but with the right resources, the effort will be worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Current Project</h2>
<p>Currently this repository is simply being used as an experiment with JavaFX. As I try and break and fix the program, I hope that I could reap some nice tricks and skills through
whatever chaotic application this repo will contain.</p>

<h2>Future Goal</h2>
<p>I plan on making a notetaking app for books, like a Netflix for Notetaking type of application using JavaFX.</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>What I learned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic JavaFX GUI components such as Stage, Scene, Layout, Nodes, Regions.</li>
  <li>Implementing a Model-View-Controller-Interactor (MVC-I) framework in Java using multiple classes.</li>
  <li>What is coupling in programming and how to avoid it for iterative updates.</li>
  <li>The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and how to leverage Builders in Java.</li>
  <li>Why it's better to work in a MVC-I framework for JavaFX compared to using the FXML method.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>What I learned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to implement a Database in Java, including performing JUnit tests on it.</li>
  <li>Modifying a Maven pom.xml file to include other dependencies.</li>
  <li>What is a DAO (Data Access Object) and how to implement one for the created Database (and how to test it).</li>
  <li>What are Domain objects and how to create a Domain to track business logic.</li>
  <li>What is a Broker and how to implement one and weave it together with the Model and Interactors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>What I learned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to add Latency and Blocking to mimic a live database.</li>
  <li>Proper practice for testing database (how to separate testing and production databases).</li>
  <li>Implemented Java Consumer interface for concurrent processes.</li>
</ul>
