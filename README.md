<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>I wanted to try my hand at some other Java technologies. It'd been a long time since I did a GUI project in Java, the latest one being a Swing GUI in high school Computer Science.
So, now I'm back, trying my hand at JavaFX. The inclination towards JavaFX mainly comes from the styling capabilities, the complexity, and the addition of CSS. 
The library has known to be a bit complex, but with the right resources, the effort will be worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Current Project</h2>
<p>Currently this repository is simply being used as an experiment with JavaFX. As I try and break and fix the program, I hope that I could reap some nice tricks and skills through
whatever chaotic application this repo will contain.</p>

<h2>Future Goal</h2>
<p>I plan on making a notetaking app for books, like a Netflix for Notetaking type of application using JavaFX.</p>
